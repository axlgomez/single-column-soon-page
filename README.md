# Ping coming soon page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

In this project I built this **Coming Soon page**.

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly. The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*
